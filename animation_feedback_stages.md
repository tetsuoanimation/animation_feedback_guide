# Feedback in the animation process
## Why this list?
To deliver animation on time and budget, getting feedback at the right time is crucial. The animation process itself is very linear and stages build on each other - this means that some changes are 'destructive' and might take a lot longer than one would anticipate. The guidelines in this file will help to get the feedback in at the right time.

## Stages and what questions they answer
### 1. Storyboard
Storyboards are drawn, non-moving sketches. They are the first translation from text to image.
#### Questions it answers:
- Who is in the shot?
- What are they doing?
- What kind of shot is it? ( Close-Up / Wide / etc. )
- What is the general visual composition of a shot?
- Where are characters roughly?
#### Possible changes / Feedback:
- Character count and characters in the shot
- Locations
- Cameras
- Visual composition

### 2. Animatic
The animatic is a "timed" version of the storyboard - this translates the raw images from the storyboard into a film, changing in time.
#### Questions it answers:
- How long is a shot?
- Where is a character moving?
- How fast is something moving?
- What are our shots ( shotnumbers )?
- How is this film edited ( edit / cuts )?
#### Possible changes / Feedback:
- Broad changes in edit and shotlength
- Adding or removing a shot
- Extra cut-ins
- Changing the camera
- Last chance to change the planned cast

### 3. Layout
Layout places assets or proxy assets in 3D space and tries to give a better idea on timing and scale of the asset. It will also create the virtual cameras and refine camera motion.
#### Questions it answers
- Which lense is used?
- Which asset is used?
- How big is an asset?
- Where in the world and on screen is an asset / character placed?
- What's the rough time / speed something will happen?
- How do all of these shots connect to each other in the edit? ( cut on movement etc )
####  Possible changes / Feedback
- Broad changes to character placement and cameras
- Splitting a shot into multiple shots
- Composition and placement of characters on screen
- Edit changes
- Changes of assets or characters

### 4. First Pass Animation - Blocking
While all other processes can be changed quite easily, once things are in animation, changes get harder and more expensive. The process that starts in blocking carries through to final animation. Any decision made here will be in the final animation.
Generally, blocking allows for pretty broad changes.
#### Questions it answers:
- How is a character posed?
- What is the emotion and action in this shot?
- Where is a character placed exactly
- What is the general expression of a character?
- Which props are used?
- How fast do things happen?
- What is happening?
####  Possible changes / Feedback:
- How a character do something
- Change general emotional feelings / acting
- Do things differently
- Change the broad strokes of speed and timing of an action
- Change general acting ideas ( preferred in animatic / layout )

### 5. Second Pass Animation - Spline and Cleanup
Second pass animation takes the blocking and smooths out the animation to make it flow naturally
#### Questions this answers:
- How "smooth" is something moving?
- How "fast" is something moving?
- Are the physics looking like we want to?
#### Possible changes / Feedback:
- Change the smoothness of an action
- Change the timing of isolated bodyparts / hand etc
- Change how much things overlap
- Change the speed of a motion ( preferred in blocking )

### 6. Animation Polish
Polish adds last tweaks to the animation to make it feel even more real. It only allows tiny tweaks like adding cloth or jiggling to something that is hanging off the character.
#### Questions this answers:
- How does the final animation look and feel?
#### Possible changes / Feedback:
- Tiny tweaks to overlap
- Tiny tweaks to contacts with ground / characters
